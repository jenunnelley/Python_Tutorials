That being said, the objects, functions, and methods described in this notebook may one day change. If changes occur, areas of this notebook that use deprecated features may cease to work and will need to be revised or omitted.

Bixby was also the founder of CPLEX, one of Gurobi's competitors, while Rothberg and Gu led the CPLEX development team for nearly a decade. Assuming that you have 1) installed Gurobi, 2) obtained a valid license, and 3) performed the necessary steps to install the Gurobi Python module, the following code block imports the gurobipy module, along with the numpy and datetime modules, that will allow us to access model problems in Python and solve them with Gurobi.\n",

    "We will use a variant of the knapsack problem to demonstrate the use of Gurobi. The knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that may be stated as:\n",

    "> \"Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The knapsack problem that we will consider is the 0-1 knapsack problem, which restricts the number of each item that may be included in the solution to zero or one. Specifically, given a set of $n$ items numbered from $1$ up to $n$, each with a weight $\\displaystyle w_{i}$ and value $\\displaystyle v_{i}$, and a maximum weight capacity $W$, the 0-1 Knapsack problem can be formulated as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the number of constraints required to model a problem can be prohibitively large, e.g., the TSP with all sub-tour elimination constraints added at the onset of optimization. However, Gurobi provides `Lazy Constraints` for adding constraints in an *as needed* fashion during an optimization run. Specifically, the user defines a set of lazy constraints, but they are not initially added to the optimization model. Whenever a new incumbent solution is found, the solver checks to see whether or not the solution violates any constraints in the pool of lazy constraints. If so, the violated constraints are added and the optimization resumes. Repeasting this process, the optimization only add the constraints that are necessary to obtain the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gurobi implements lazy constraints using callbacks. A callback is essentially a function that can interact with an optimization model. A complete understanding of callbacks is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but additional information can be found at www.gurobi.com. The following code block generates a 100-item instance that we will use for this demonstration.\n",

    "In this section, we will look at the use of callbacks to add cutting planes during an optimization. Recall that **the lazy constraint method added constraints that defined the feasible region of the associated problem**. Essentially, the approach added these constraints as needed instead of adding them all at the onset of the optimization. **In contrast, cutting planes are typically applied at nodes of the branch & bound tree and can change the feasible space of the continuous relaxation without ruling out any feasible integer solution that the rest of the model permits.** You can read more about the difference between user cuts and lazy constraints at https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P_12.6.1/ilog.odms.cplex.help/CPLEX/UsrMan/topics/progr_adv/usr_cut_lazy_constr/04_diffs.html and https://orinanobworld.blogspot.com/2012/08/user-cuts-versus-lazy-constraints.html (both accessed 1/2/2019).\n",

These techniques includes presolving modifications, heuristic procedures, methods for generating several classes of cutting planes, and methods to distribute the tasks associated with solving an optimization problem accross multiple computer cores. **If you want to use callbacks to implement a custom cutting plane procedure, you must disable several of these features including presolve modifications, and distributed computing**. \n",
