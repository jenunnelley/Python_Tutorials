# Python_Tutorials
This folder contains several notebook files that introduce various aspects of the Python programming language and some popular packages such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. Clicking the Binder icon below will launch a Jupyter-like file browser where you can access and run interactive versions of most notebooks in this repository. The exception is the notebook demonstrating Gurobi's optimization library. The former notebook require Gurobi optimization software to be installed on the running machine with a valid license. See http://www.gurobi.com/ for more details on Gurobi optimization software. The latter notebook requires more RAM than is available via Binder.
